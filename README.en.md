Description of the project

This project is a test application on React, which uses all possible libraries to implement user cards. It implements interactivity and working with APIs, and also uses collectors for native JS.

Technical task
According to the layout, user cards with a "Follow" button, which changes its state and color when pressed, were implemented. Also, the number of followers increases by 1. When the page is refreshed, the state of the button is saved, and the number of followers does not change to the initial value. When you press the button again, it returns to its initial state and the number of followers decreases by 1. The number 100,500 is written in the code with one value - 100500, but it is displayed through a comma in the interface - 100,500.

To implement the backend, the mockapi.io UI service was used, where the "follower" resource was created with the fields id, user, tweets, followers, avatar, isFollower. A separate avatar image was uploaded for each user.

Performance criteria
